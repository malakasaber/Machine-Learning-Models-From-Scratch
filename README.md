# Machine Learning Models From Scratch

This repository contains fundamental implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy**, without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`. The goal is to understand how these models work internally and provide educational insight into their mechanics.

Each folder includes clean, readable code implementing a specific model or family of models, following a modular and educational design.

## Features

- **Linear Regression** via:
  - Gradient Descent
  - Normal Equation
- **Logistic Regression** (Coming Soon)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** (Coming Soon)
- More models under construction!

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````


## Goals

* Reinforce the mathematical foundations of machine learning.
* Gain intuition on how different optimization techniques work.
* Create an educational playground for new learners and developers.
